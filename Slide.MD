* The web = network of connected computers sharing information
* **Browser (client)** requests pages
* **Server** stores and delivers content
* Typing a URL begins a connection between the two

# **Slide 2 — The Request / Response Cycle**

* Browser sends an **HTTP request** for a resource
* Server returns an **HTTP response** with the result
* Status codes:

  * **200** — success
  * **404** — not found
* **HTTPS** encrypts communication for security

---
